Review use of T_GD

problem with signal going below threshold losing C/A sync

try loading signal data as s16 all the way into the correlator 
functions to see if this helps with bandwidth issues, 
this will require s16->f32 conversion (sse?) at corr Func .

also try s16 for cos/sin + s8 for spreading code?

TOW roll over mitigation in subframe/word syncronization
  TOW for subframe is (msg.TOW + MAX_TOW - 1) % MAX_TOW

  Figure how to calculate corrilation threshold for real data
    possible keep two sums one of correlator the other of abs(signal)

DONE:
Replace library code with my own code for least squares routines / matrix inversion
