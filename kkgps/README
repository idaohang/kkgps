IMPORTANT
  THIS IS A PROTOTYPE. THE CODE WILL CHANGE, FILES WILL BE REMOVED, CLASSES 
  WILL BE SLAUGHTERED.

BUILDING
To do a clean build of kkGPS
  $ make clean all
 
Only standard GNU C++ libraries are used

Currently the correlator type is selected in the makefile by uncommenting
the appropriate line in this block in makefile

        ##########################################
        #SELECT correlator type
        #uncomment next line for generic c++ correlator
        CORROBJ = gps_corr_generic.o
        #uncomment next line for SSE1 optimized correlator
        #CORROBJ = gps_corr_sse1.o
        #uncomment next line for G4 altivec optimized correlator
        #CORROBJ = gps_corr_g4_altivec.o
        ##########################################


EXECUTABLE FILES
The following executables will be generated

kkgps: 
  Runs the GPS receiver with a simulated set of six satellites. About
  42 seconds into the simulation the download of the Ephemeris data will 
  be completed and the output will change to display satellite and user 
  position information.
  
testunit:
  Tests a bunch of functions and classes as well as displaying 
  timing information for various critical routines (like the correlator)
  
testorbit: 
  Prints out 24 hours of position information for a satellite selected in
  testorbit.cpp

The following executables will not be generated by default

async_parse: 
  Used to parse data files generated by the ASYNC program[1]


MISCELLANEOUS

There are six files named 273673_{09,21,22,23,26,29}.txt these contain
one frame of the C/A navigation message from their respective satellites.
These were acquired using a GARMIN GPSmap76S and the ASYNC program[1]



[1] http://artico.lma.fi.upm.es/numerico/miembros/antonio/async/
    A program that downloads various types of raw data from GARMIN GPS 
    receivers.
